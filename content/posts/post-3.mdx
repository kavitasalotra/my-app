### **Reinvention often comes in spurts, after a long period of silence. Just as modern architecture recently enjoyed a comeback, brand architecture, a field with well-established principles for decades, is back in the limelight.**

<br />
Simply understood, brand architecture is the art and science of structuring the portfolio
to meet your strategic goals, defining the brand number, scope, and relationships
needed to compete. Just as Modern Architecture prioritized function, a Brand Architecture
is only as good as it is well-suited for the purpose it strives to achieve. Given
the disruption observed today across industries and segments, it’s no wonder that
companies are considering structural rather than topical solutions to the challenges
they face.

<br />
Yet the context in which brand architecture decisions are being made has changed.
Gone are the days of “competitive strategy”, with the military-inspired view of competition
as a zero-sum game, where market share needs to be stolen from competitors, often
in a street-by-street battle to win over each individual segment. The type of brand
architecture required to win in this game demanded a dogged focus on each segment,
and a sniper-like collection of individual brands sharply focused on each one. While
there was always a place for a variety of architectures — see Joachimsthaler’s brand
relationship spectrum — houses of brands were favored, as it enabled segment-by-segment
competition and risk protection. P&G was the king of houses of brands, slicing and
dicing the market not just by products and demographics, but also by psychographics,
price range, buying patterns or attitudes. In B2B, houses of brands were omnipresent,
with a product-driven logic that led to branding new features meant to provide short-term
competitive advantage.

<br />
Instead, investing in a strong master brand-led architecture and putting multiple
if not all brands under the leadership of a strong brand, presents numerous advantages.
First, mergers and acquisitions, or partnerships, are making it necessary to bring
multiple market participants to “the same page” — and this common ground often involves
a master brand recognized by all. Second, the risk profile of a “branded house” architecture
has changed: the master brand can create an aura of innovation and risk-taking, supporting
the launch of new products. Third, investments can be streamlined, as a strong master
brand can be leveraged across markets and product launches. Finally, a track record
of success in creating new categories can create goodwill, creating a virtual circle
of success. To achieve this, brand architecture does not need to be a pure “branded
house” — in many cases, a strong master brand creates substantial leverage and a
much cleaner portfolio, even as a few particularly strong brands can continue existing
as sub-brands. An example of this is Salesforce, that leverages its master brand
consistently — yet allows more independence to a few specific sub-brands, such as
Pardot.
