In 2007, the now-defunct San Antonio Independent Christian Film Festival awarded Best of Festival to a documentary called _The Monstrous Regiment of Women_, a film that simultaneously asserted that women leading families or nations is antithetical to the Bible, vilified feminists (as Marxists and destroyers of the home), and called legalized abortion an “unparalleled holocaust.” I’m in the midst of researching for a book, and it was already on my calendar last week to rewatch _The Monstrous Regiment of Women the day after Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito’s [draft opinion on Roe leaked.](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473)_

I braced myself. My social media feeds were flooded with _Handmaid’s Tale_ references, a fiction now feeling too real. But the goals of women’s submission are not fictional.

The title of the film comes from an essay by founder of the Presbyterian Church of Scotland, John Knox, who wrote the tract: “The First Blast of the Trumpet Against the Monstrous Regiment of Women” in 1558 in opposition to female political leaders such as Mary I of England, who persecuted Protestant Christians, and thanks to whom, Knox had found himself exiled and out of a job. Knox wrote: “how abominable before God is the Empire or Rule of a wicked woman, yea, of a traiteresse and bastard.”

Next, the film leaps forward to damn modern feminism. Christians, the narrator says, cannot be egalitarians — those who believe all people are equal and deserve equal rights and opportunities. Phyllis Schlafly, who successfully galvanized opposition to ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment, was featured in an interview, saying “the problem with feminism — the principle problem — is the cultivation of an attitude of victimization. Feminism tries to make women think they are victims of an oppressive, male-dominated, patriarchal society.” Further, she asserts the feminist movement set out to make the role of fulltime wife and homemaker economically impossible and socially disdained.

“I do not believe Hillary Clinton will be elected president,” said Schlafly. “She is not a likeable woman… she’s angry about lots of things, and that isn’t the sort of person we want to lead this country.”

The rest of the film is a soup of common evangelical talking points: a segment of what appears to be a late-term abortion (without any context) from the Center for Bio-Ethical Reform, an anti-abortion group that produces abortion videos for show in churches and college campuses. This is followed by a woman who claims to have been an abortion profiteer prior to her conversion to Christianity. She describes how in her abortionist past, she’d worked to provoke girls ages 13–18 to have three abortions apiece, in part by increasing sexual activity among girls by bringing sex education and easy-to-miss-a-day birth control into schools.

Claiming intellectual links between Betty Friedan, Engels, and Marx, Chancey extrapolates that the goal of communism is only accomplished by displacing fathers as head of Christian families and getting children into state-run schools. It’s this strategic linkage of anxieties that marks this worldview: if women working or women in leadership concerns you, then so too should public school (where your kids can’t be taught Christian values anyway!). Similarly, if, despite other evangelical convictions, you take part in school or work or female leadership, then you may be contributing to a socialist overthrow of America. Right Christian action would entail rejecting the gamut.
